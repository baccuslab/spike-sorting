function groupcw(outfile, datafiles, snipfiles, channels, noise_channels)
% groupcw: Shape sorting of snippet waveforms
%
% The function groupcw is the entry point for the shape-based spike waveform
% clustering application, used to sort spikes. 
%
% INPUT:
%	outfile		- Output file, in which the Matlab struct containing information
%					about the sorting process, as well as sorted spikes, will
%					be saved.
%
%	datafiles	- A single string or cell array of strings, giving the paths
%					to the HDF5 files containing raw multi-electrode array data.
%
% 	snipfiles	- A single string or cell array of strings, giving the paths
%					to the HDF5 files containing the extracted candidate spike
%					and noise snippets. These are the outputs of the `extract` program.
%	
%	channels	- An array of the channel numbers from which data should be sorted.
%                   If not given, or given as [], data will be sorted from
%                   all channels in the files.
%   
%   noise_channels - An array of channel numbers from which noise should be
%                   drawn. Defaults to same as `channels`
%
% CALLING:
%
% The program may be called in two ways. If just the `outfile` is specified, the
% application will continue sorting a previous session. The output file given must
% exist.
%
% Alternatively, the first three arguments can be given, in order to start a new
% sorting session with the given data and snippet files. The final argument, 
% `channels`, is optional in this case. If not given, all data channels from which
% snippets were extracted will be included in the sorting.
%
% HISTORY:
%
% The original version of the application was written by Tim Holy and Stephen 
% Baccus, between 1999 and 2004. The application was updated in 2015, to operate
% with a new HDF5 file format adopted in the Baccus lab. Contributors for the 
% update include: Pablo Jadzinsky, Lane McIntosh, Benjamin Naecker, Aran Nayebi,
% and Bongsoo Suh.
